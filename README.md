# Flutter Screen Theme plugin

This plugin for [Flutter](https://flutter.io) adds the ability to change the status bar theme: light or dark (Android and iOS).
It also provides the ability to change the navigation bar theme and color (Android only)

## Getting Started

On iOS only, please add in your Info.plist:
```xml
<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
<false/>
```

Then you just have to import the package in your dart files with
```dart
import 'package:screentheme/screentheme.dart';
```

For each call, you can specify which platform you want to target (by default both):
```dart
ScreenTheme.darkStatusBar(platform: Platform.Android);
```

Each call returns a boolean, which is `true` when the platform and the OS version support the feature.
For the navigation bar, all calls will throw a `MissingPluginException`.
